# cewler
Automates cewl and rsmangler tools. See https://github.com/digininja for more info

    usage: bash cewler target.com

Will prompt you to run rsmangler which is optional - permutations is off for speed (and to not crush memory).

This has no error catching, and ugly code is ugly..you have been warned.
(I am not a programmer, but needed something to automate the process for myself)

I may add gobuster to process all of this as one large process against a single target, ie: create wordlist(s), run dns subdomain checks with gobuster, as well as directory and file searches using the combo wordlist.

I'm sure there is a quicker way to loop through the rsmangler section. Feel free to comment and send me updates, I could use some help with this and look forward to feedback. School me on how I could have done this with less code and quicker!
